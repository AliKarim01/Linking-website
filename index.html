        You must have recently heard more about “social media” and “social media marketing.” The term “social media” is
        used
        frequently to describe what we share on websites and applications like Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook,
        etc.
        So, in a nutshell, social media are web-based platforms that allow users to engage with one another.Social media
        relates to networking sites and apps designed for people to swiftly and effectively post information in
        real-time.
        While many users use mobile apps to reach social media, this communication channel originated on computers. The
        concept of Social Media is so broad that you may use it to describe nearly any site on the internet nowadays.

        Can it, though?

        Some people have a more limited understanding of social media, often conflating it with networking sites (a.k.a.
        Facebook, Instagram, etc.). Others do not consider blogs to be part of the social media genre.

        Everyone appears to have their definition of what social media is or is not. However, to acquire better and more
        accurate knowledge, let us delve deeper into the broad concept.</b>

                <li>Facebook:</li>
            </u></h3><br><br>
        Facebook began in February of 2004 as a school-based social network at Harvard University. It was created by
        Mark Zuckerberg along with Edward Saverin, both students at the college. It wasn't until 2006 that Facebook
        opened to anyone 13 years or older and took off, rapidly overtaking MySpace as the most popular social network
        in the world.Facebook is user-friendly and open to everyone. Even the least technical-minded people can sign up
        and begin posting on Facebook. Although it started out as a way to keep in touch or reconnect with long-lost
        friends, it rapidly became the darling of businesses that were able to closely target an audience and deliver
        ads directly to the people most likely to want their products or services.

        Facebook's success can be attributed to its ability to appeal to both people and businesses and its ability to
        interact with sites around the web by providing a single login that works across multiple sites.<br><br>
